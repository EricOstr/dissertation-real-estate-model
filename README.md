# dissertation-real-estate-model
This dissertation investigates real-estate price dynamics by constructing a heterogeneous agent-based model of boundedly rational agents. The model accounts for pricing strategies based on past market fundamentals and past price development with agents altering behaviour according to a social dynamic. The behaviour of the model is examined with respect to various parameters and reveal that real-estate price instability depends crucially on features that characterize different types of real-estate. In addition, the effectiveness and limitations of several price reduction policies are assessed through simulations. The results suggest that policies which increase the elasticity of supply result in desirable market fundamentals and a trade-off in terms of increased real-estate price volatility. In contrast, policies increasing the elasticity of demand and interest rate yield a more stable real-estate market, although with less desirable market fundamental outcomes. These insights inform policymakers of critical features and tradeoffs to account for when addressing the real-estate market's price volatility.
